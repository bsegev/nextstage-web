WHEN THEY SAY: "I can find a freelancer for less"
RESPONSE: "You can find a freelancer for $X, but they'll take twice as long and you'll need to manage them. I deliver better results, faster, with less hassle. The question is: what's your time worth?"

WHEN THEY SAY: "I can do this myself"
RESPONSE: "You probably can. The question is: should you? While you're spending 3 months figuring this out, your competitors are moving. I can get you there in 3 weeks."

WHEN THEY SAY: "This seems expensive"
RESPONSE: "Expensive compared to what? If you're looking for cheap, I'm not your guy. But I'm not here to rip you off either. This is what professional results cost."
