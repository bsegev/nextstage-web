BRAND POSITIONING & MESSAGING FRAMEWORK
==================================================

CORE BRAND POSITIONING:
NextStage is a boutique consulting firm that delivers integrated strategy, design, and technology solutions in 4-6 weeks (vs industry standard 4-6 months). We position against Big 4 consulting through five archetypal characteristics:

- **Henry V Embedded Partnership**: We stand with clients, not above them - embedded leadership in the trenches
- **Jason Bourne Execution Speed**: Startup velocity with enterprise quality - precise, efficient, no wasted motion  
- **Rick Rubin Creative Insight**: Strip to essence, bring out what's already there - conceptual clarity without spiritual fluff
- **Harvey Specter Problem Solving**: We're fixers who handle complex situations - sophisticated solutions delivered with confidence
- **Hemingway Communication**: Simplicity without oversimplifying - clear, direct language that cuts through noise

KEY DIFFERENTIATORS:
- **The Convergence Cycle**: Strategy + Design + Technology working as one integrated team
- **Anti-Big 4**: Plain language for ESL founders/teams, no handoffs or jargon, real deliverables vs presentations
- **Speed Advantage**: 4-6 weeks vs 4-6 months industry standard
- **Embedded Partnership**: Side-by-side collaboration, not top-down consulting

TARGET AUDIENCE: 
Founders, executives, and teams building what's next who've been burned by slow, theoretical consulting or need breakthrough results fast.
