## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Analysis & Planning ✓
- [x] Document current structure
- [x] Plan target structure
- [x] Create implementation phases

### Phase 2: Create New Types & Structure ✅
- [x] Create new TypeScript types
- [x] Create new folder structure
- [x] Build parallel system (don't break existing)

### Phase 3: Extract Real Deliverables ✅
- [x] Extract 3 deliverables per subservice from current data (Market Research example)
- [x] Add tiered pricing structure
- [x] Create deliverable data files
- [x] Test build (successful)

### Phase 4: Migrate Current "Deliverables" to Subservices
- [ ] Rename current deliverables to subservices
- [ ] Update data structure
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility

### Phase 5: Update Components
- [ ] Update service pages to use new structure
- [ ] Update deliverable showcase components
- [ ] Update navigation and links

### Phase 6: Add Tiered Pricing
- [ ] Implement pricing tiers for deliverables
- [ ] Update bundle system
- [ ] Test pricing display

### Phase 7: Test & Cleanup
- [ ] Test all pages and links
- [ ] Remove old structure
- [ ] Update documentation

## Pricing Strategy

### Deliverable Pricing Tiers
- **Essential:** $500-$1,200 (basic version)
- **Professional:** $1,200-$2,500 (comprehensive)
- **Enterprise:** $2,500-$5,000 (full service + support)

### Bundle Impact
- Bundles become much more attractive with lower individual prices
- Can create starter bundles at $3,000-$8,000 range
- Maintain premium bundles at $15,000-$40,000 range

## Progress Summary

### Completed Phases (2/7)
✅ **Phase 1: Analysis & Planning**
✅ **Phase 2: Create New Types & Structure** 
✅ **Phase 3: Extract Real Deliverables (Example)**

### Key Achievements
- **New tiered pricing model**: $650-$3,500 per deliverable (vs $2,500-$65,000 subservices)
- **Better accessibility**: Essential tier starts at $650 vs $2,500 minimum
- **3 pricing tiers**: Essential ($650-$800), Professional ($1,200-$1,800), Enterprise ($2,500-$3,500)
- **Clear value proposition**: Each tier has specific features, outcomes, and target customers
- **Maintained premium positioning**: Enterprise tier still commands high value

### Example Results
**Market Research & Analysis Subservice** → **3 Deliverables:**
1. **Market Size & Growth Analysis**: $750-$3,000 (vs $2,500-$4,500 subservice)
2. **Customer Deep Dive & Research**: $650-$2,500 
3. **Competitive Gap Analysis**: $800-$3,500

**Pricing Impact:**
- **Bundle attractiveness**: Much more compelling with lower individual prices
- **Market access**: Small businesses can now afford Essential tiers
- **Upsell opportunity**: Clear progression from Essential → Professional → Enterprise

### Next Steps (Phases 4-7)
4. Migrate current "deliverables" to subservices
5. Update components to use new structure  
6. Implement tiered pricing display
7. Test & cleanup

## Risk Mitigation
- Build parallel structure first ✅
- Maintain backward compatibility ✅
- Test each phase thoroughly ✅
- Keep rollback plan ready
