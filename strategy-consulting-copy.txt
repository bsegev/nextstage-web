# Strategy & Consulting
## Transform your business with strategic insights and expert guidance

### Hero Section
**Headline:** Strategy That Actually Executes
**Subheadline:** Most strategic plans fail because they're built in isolation. We design strategy alongside the systems, people, and processes that will bring it to life.

**Value Proposition:** 
The gap between great strategy and great execution isn't a gap—it's a chasm. At NextStage, we don't just hand you a beautiful deck and wish you luck. We build strategy that comes pre-wired for execution, with clear ownership, measurable milestones, and the operational foundation to make it stick.
