# Fibonacci Spiral Animation - Brand Design CTA
## Planning Notes - UPDATED: Classic Rectangle Spiral Design

### Animation Approach: Shape Animation (not Assembly)
- Classic Fibonacci rectangle spiral with dots following the curved path
- Similar to StrategyCTA.tsx DNA helix approach
- Scroll-based transformations applied to the entire formed spiral

### Visual Structure - NEW DESIGN
1. **Fibonacci Rectangles**: Subtle outline rectangles (1x1, 1x1, 2x2, 3x3, 5x5, 8x8, 13x13)
2. **Golden Spiral Curve**: Dots following the classic curved path through rectangles
3. **Central Design Core**: Pulsing center point representing brand foundation
4. **Progressive Dot Sizing**: Larger dots at key fibonacci transitions
5. **Rectangle Outlines**: Faint grid showing the mathematical structure

### Mathematical Foundation - UPDATED
```javascript
// Fibonacci sequence for rectangles
const fibSequence = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21];

// Rectangle positioning (cumulative)
// 1x1, 1x1 (side by side) = 2x1 total
// Add 2x2 below = 2x3 total  
// Add 3x3 to right = 5x3 total
// Add 5x5 below = 5x8 total
// Add 8x8 to left = 13x8 total

// Curved spiral path through rectangle quarters
for each rectangle in sequence:
  quarterArc = 90° arc through that rectangle's corner
  dots positioned along this arc path
  
// Dot count per rectangle proportional to fibonacci number
const dotsPerRect = [3, 3, 5, 8, 12, 18, 24]; // roughly fib/2
```

### Scroll-Based Animation Phases - UPDATED
1. **Phase 1 (0-30% scroll)**: Rectangle outlines fade in, dots begin subtle pulsing
2. **Phase 2 (30-70% scroll)**: Spiral path becomes prominent, dots flow along curve
3. **Phase 3 (70-100% scroll)**: Full rotation, rectangle highlights, mathematical perfection

### Animation Properties - UPDATED
- **Spiral Rotation**: Entire structure rotates 0° to 180°
- **Rectangle Fade**: Outlines fade from 0 to 0.3 opacity
- **Dot Flow**: Dots appear to "flow" along the spiral path with wave animation
- **Progressive Reveal**: Rectangles and dots reveal in fibonacci sequence order
- **Scale Breathing**: Gentle scale 0.9x to 1.1x for organic feel

### Design Philosophy - ENHANCED
- **Instantly Recognizable**: The classic golden ratio symbol everyone knows
- **Mathematical Perfection**: Shows precise fibonacci/golden ratio relationships
- **Design Heritage**: References centuries of design and art principles
- **Brand Foundation**: Rectangle structure = systematic brand building
- **Organic Growth**: Spiral represents natural, sustainable brand evolution

### Implementation Steps - UPDATED
1. Create fibonacci rectangle grid structure
2. Calculate curved spiral path through rectangle quarters  
3. Position dots along the spiral curve
4. Add rectangle outline animations
5. Implement progressive reveal and flow effects
6. Add scroll-based transformations

### Color Scheme - REFINED
- **Rectangle Outlines**: #FFE0D7 with 0.2 opacity (barely visible structure)
- **Spiral Dots**: Alternating #FFE0D7 and #FFFFFF with size progression
- **Central Core**: Radial gradient accent (design foundation)
- **Flow Effect**: Subtle gradient along spiral path
- **Mathematical Grid**: Ultra-subtle grid lines showing proportions
