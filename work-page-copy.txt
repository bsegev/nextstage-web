NEXTSTAGE WORK PAGE COPY AUDIT
====================================

## CONTEXT & ROLE SETTING:
NextStage is a boutique consulting firm that delivers integrated strategy, design, and technology solutions in 4-6 weeks (vs industry standard 4-6 months). We position against Big 4 consulting through:

- **Henry V Embedded Partnership**: We stand with clients, not above them
- **Jason Bourne Execution Speed**: Startup velocity with enterprise quality  
- **The Convergence Cycle**: Strategy + Design + Technology working as one team
- **Anti-Big 4**: Plain language for ESL founders/teams, no handoffs or jargon

**Work Page Purpose**: Showcase real transformations and case studies to prove our integration advantage and speed claims. This is where skeptical prospects become believers.

**Target Audience**: Founders, executives, and teams who've been burned by traditional consulting or agencies that overpromise and underdeliver.
