  // Pattern: Routing - Classify user responses with enhanced guardrails
  static buildClassificationPrompt(input: string, state: ConversationState): string {
    const context = this.buildContextString(state);
    
    return `${this.buildSystemPrompt()}

CONVERSATION CONTEXT:
${context}

USER INPUT TO CLASSIFY:
"${input}"

CLASSIFICATION TASK:
Classify this input into ONE category. Consider context and strategic value:

CATEGORIES:
- "basic_info": Name, contact details, simple factual responses
- "business_strategy": Business model, market analysis, competitive positioning, revenue strategy
- "problem_definition": Core problems, pain points, challenges being solved
- "vision_goals": Success metrics, future state, desired outcomes, growth goals
- "technical_details": Implementation specifics, features, technical requirements
- "off_topic": Personal, unrelated, or non-business topics
- "generic": Simple responses that don't fit other categories

CLASSIFICATION RULES:
1. Prioritize business strategy and problem definition (highest strategic value)
2. If mentions business concepts but lacks depth, classify as "generic" 
3. If completely unrelated to business/strategy, classify as "off_topic"
4. Consider conversation phase - early responses may be more basic

Respond with ONLY the category name. No explanation.`;

  // Enhanced evaluation with success criteria from Anthropic guide

    const context = this.buildContextString(state);
    
    return `${this.buildSystemPrompt()}

CONVERSATION CONTEXT:
${context}

LATEST USER RESPONSE:
"${input}"

EVALUATION TASK:
Determine if a strategic follow-up question would add significant value (YES/NO).

EVALUATION CRITERIA (from Anthropic best practices):
1. **Response Depth**: Is the answer too shallow for strategic planning?
2. **Strategic Value**: Does it reveal business insights, market dynamics, competitive advantages?
3. **Actionability**: Can we make specific strategic recommendations from this?
4. **Completeness**: Are there obvious strategic gaps a follow-up could fill?
5. **Business Context**: Would more context help understand market opportunity?

FOLLOW-UP RULES:
✅ Generate follow-up if:
- Response mentions strategy/market/competition but lacks depth
- Business model or revenue strategy unclear
- Market dynamics or customer insights missing
- Competitive positioning not well-defined
- Growth strategy or scaling plans vague

❌ Skip follow-up if:
- Response is basic personal info (name, contact)
- User seems rushed or gives very short answers
- We already have enough context for this strategic area
- Response is off-topic or generic
- Maximum 2 follow-ups per topic already reached

QUALITY TARGET: 90%+ relevance, 95%+ comprehension accuracy

Respond: "YES - [brief strategic reasoning]" or "NO - [brief reason]"`;

QUESTION GENERATION TASK:
Generate the next strategic question that provides maximum business value.

STRATEGIC PRIORITIES (in order of importance):

4. **Competitive Landscape & Differentiation** - What's their unique advantage?
5. **Growth Strategy & Success Metrics** - How will they scale and measure success?
6. **Implementation Timeline & Resource Requirements** - When and how will they execute?

QUESTION REQUIREMENTS:
- Ask about the most valuable missing strategic information
- Build naturally on previous answers (show you're listening)
- Use client's name if known
- Keep conversational and engaging (not interview-style)
- Focus on business insights, not just features

CLIENT'S LATEST RESPONSE:
"${input}"

FOLLOW-UP TASK:
Generate a thoughtful follow-up that extracts deeper strategic insights.

4. **Business Impact**: Understand revenue, growth, or operational implications
5. **Strategic Choices**: Ask about the "why" behind their decisions

PROVEN FOLLOW-UP PATTERNS:

- "I'm curious about the competitive angle - how are others trying to solve this?"
- "What led you to focus on [market/segment] specifically?"
- "How does [their approach] change the game for [their customers]?"

STRATEGIC VALUE TARGET:
Generate insights that help with market positioning, competitive strategy, business model optimization, or growth planning.

Generate ONE follow-up question that:
- References their specific response details  
- Seeks strategic business insights
- Feels natural and engaging
- Helps with strategic brief development

Format:
QUESTION: [Your strategic follow-up question]
REASONING: [Strategic insights this will provide for their brief]`;
