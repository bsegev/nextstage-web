NEXTSTAGE ABOUT PAGE COPY AUDIT
====================================

## CONTEXT & ROLE SETTING:
NextStage is a boutique consulting firm that delivers integrated strategy, design, and technology solutions in 4-6 weeks (vs industry standard 4-6 months). We position against Big 4 consulting through five archetypal characteristics:

- **Henry V Embedded Partnership**: We stand with clients, not above them - embedded leadership in the trenches
- **Jason Bourne Execution Speed**: Startup velocity with enterprise quality - precise, efficient, no wasted motion  
- **Rick Rubin Creative Insight**: Strip to essence, bring out what's already there - conceptual clarity without spiritual fluff
- **Harvey Specter Problem Solving**: We're fixers who handle complex situations - sophisticated solutions delivered with confidence
- **Hemingway Communication**: Simplicity without oversimplifying - clear, direct language that cuts through noise

**The Convergence Cycle**: Strategy + Design + Technology working as one integrated team
**Anti-Big 4**: Plain language for ESL founders/teams, no handoffs or jargon, real deliverables vs presentations

**About Page Purpose**: Build founder credibility and trust by telling the personal story behind NextStage's methodology, positioning against traditional consulting through authentic narrative and embedded partnership approach.

**Target Audience**: Prospects who want to understand WHO they're working with before committing - founders and executives who value personal connection and authentic leadership.

**Signature Quote:** "I'm not here to present your strategy. I'm here to build it with you."

**Team Section:** "The Integrated Team"
