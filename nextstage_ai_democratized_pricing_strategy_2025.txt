CLIENT CONVERSATION FRAMEWORK
================================================================

"I can do this with ChatGPT"
→ "Absolutely! And you'll spend 3 months learning what I already know. While you're figuring it out, your competitors are moving. What's 3 months of your time worth?"

"AI tools are getting so good"
→ "They are! But they're tools, not strategists. I know which prompts work, which don't, and how to apply the results strategically. Tools are commoditized, knowledge isn't."

"Why should I pay you when I have these tools?"
→ "Same reason you hire a chef when you have a kitchen. Having the tools doesn't mean you know how to use them well. I can do in 2 days what takes most people 2 months."

"This seems expensive for something AI can do"
→ "AI can write words. I create messaging that converts. AI can generate designs. I create brands that build trust. The tool is cheap, the expertise is valuable."

VS. DIY WITH AI:
"You could absolutely do this yourself. It'll take 6 months, cost you opportunity, and you'll probably need to redo it. I can get you there in 6 weeks."

VS. FREELANCERS:
"Freelancers are learning AI on your dime. I've already mastered it. You get better results, faster, with less risk."

VS. AGENCIES:
"Agencies are still figuring out AI. I've integrated it into everything. You get agency quality at freelancer speed."

================================================================
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY
================================================================

PHASE 1: ACKNOWLEDGE THE REALITY
- "Yes, you can use AI for this"
- "Most people get mediocre results"
- "Here's why you shouldn't"

PHASE 2: DEMONSTRATE EXPERTISE
- Show AI-enhanced processes
- Share before/after examples
- Prove the knowledge difference

PHASE 3: PRICE ON VALUE
- Time savings calculation
- Opportunity cost analysis
- Quality difference demonstration

================================================================
OBJECTION HANDLING
================================================================

"I can get this done for free with AI"
→ "You can get it done. Getting it done well is different. How much is your time worth? How much will redoing it cost?"

"ChatGPT can write copy"
→ "ChatGPT can write words. I write copy that converts. There's a difference between content and strategy."

"These tools are getting so good"
→ "They are! But they need someone who knows how to use them strategically. Having a Formula 1 car doesn't make you Lewis Hamilton."

"Why not just teach me to do it myself?"
→ "I could. That's coaching, not consulting. Do you want to become a marketer, or do you want marketing results?"
