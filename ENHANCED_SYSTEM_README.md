## 🛠 Setup Requirements

```bash
# Anthropic API (already configured)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here

# For web search (optional, will use fallback if not set)
BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY=your_brave_api_key
```

### Brave Search API (Optional)
- Sign up at: https://api.search.brave.com/
- Free tier: 2000 queries/month
- Cost: $0.50 per 1000 queries after free tier

## 🔄 How It Works

### Conversation Flow
1. User starts conversation at `/enhanced-chat`
2. System extracts information using Claude
3. Generates intelligent follow-up questions
4. Shows real-time understanding of user inputs
5. Completes when sufficient information gathered

### Brief Generation Process
1. Claude analyzes conversation and plans research
2. Uses web search tools to gather:
   - Market size and growth data
   - Competitive landscape
   - Industry trends
   - Funding patterns
3. Generates strategic brief with real research data
4. Displays brief with market intelligence summary

## 🆚 Comparison: Original vs Enhanced
